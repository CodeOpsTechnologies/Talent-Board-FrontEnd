This is a community initiative to connect active job seekers with organizations and people who participate in employee referral programs.

Currently we encourage only job seekers / candidates who lost their jobs in the pandemic scenario. Referrals should be verified via Linkedin profiles. (Click Linkedin Connect-> Save profile as PDF-> Refer). As a community, it will be a win-win situation for all of us if we can support and make the future safe for one another. Help them to resume their career by referring. #refer2resume

## Contribution Guidelines
[![GitHub pull requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr-raw/CodeOpsTechnologies/talent-board-fe?logo=git&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/CodeOpsTechnologies/talent-board-fe/compare) [![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/CodeOpsTechnologies/talent-board-fe?logo=github)](https://github.com/CodeOpsTechnologies/talent-board-fe/graphs/contributors) [![Vinit Shahdeo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-@smilegupta-gray.svg?colorA=gray&colorB=dodgerblue&logo=github)](https://github.com/smilegupta/)
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (Check [this](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) for more info)
- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at [here](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
- Always create PR to `develop` branch.
- Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Refer [this](https://github.com/CodeOpsTechnologies/talent-board-fe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
